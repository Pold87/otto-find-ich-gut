* Overview

WE WILL UPDATE THIS REPOSITORY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE (23 June 2015)

** Current approach
- Use Lasagne and XGB in Python to create an Ensemble classifier

*** Involved files
- IPython: XGBoost (XGBoost in Python, using hyperopt)
- IPython: Otto_Group_Competition - REAL GOOD (lasagne, using hyperopt)

** What have I done
- I have an Ensemble classifier with voting
- I have a postprocessing smoother that finds optimal probability values
- A have hyperopt that find optimal hyperparameter values

** TODO:
- Include STD and M per row as feature
- Use condtional formatting (color coding in Excel) for submission file
- Use for next submission:
  -- H20: h20newsubmission.csv (25 trials) (Script: otto-find-ich-gut/h2onew.R)
  -- XGB: xgboostpython_full_submission.csv (Script: IPython_Submissions/XGBoost.py)
  -- Keras: keras-otto-final.csv (Script: IPython_Submission/keras.py)
  -- Lasagne: lasagne-otto-final.csv (Script: IPython_Submissions/lasagne.ipynb)
